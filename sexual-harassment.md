   - They make invasive gestures or movements.

3. Non-verbal Harassment:

   - They send unsolicited sexually explicit texts, emails, or messages.

   - They make inappropriate hand gestures or physical gestures.

### What would you do if you faced or witnessed any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

If you encounter or witness sexual harassment, take the following actions:

1. Speak up (if safe to do so):

   - If you feel comfortable, calmly and firmly tell the person about their inappropriate behavior and that you do not welcome it.

2. Document the Incident:

   - Write down the details of the incident, including dates, times, locations, and the individuals involved. This documentation can help if you decide to report the incident later.

3. Report the Incident:

   - Report the behavior to your employer, school, or the appropriate authority. Many organizations have procedures for handling sexual harassment.

  - If you witness harassment, encourage the harassed person to report it or offer to assist them in reporting.

4. Support the Victim:

   - If you witness the harassment, offer emotional support to the person affected. Let them know they are not alone and that their feelings are valid.

5. Seek External Help:

   - If the behavior continues or internal reporting doesn’t resolve the issue, seek help from external organizations like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or local law enforcement, depending on the severity of the situation.

6. Encourage Education and Prevention:

   - Advocate for workplace or school policies that address sexual harassment and promote respectful behavior. Encourage training and awareness programs to prevent future incidents.
